# TechStop - Created in C++

An electronic shop billing system known as TECH-STOP which is based on a concept of storing and billing of electronic products. It is a concept to generate daily payment transactions bill. TechStop also generates reports for the admin to analyse its progress.

PS: This was the first project created in my engineering career. It is very basic and just for beginners.
