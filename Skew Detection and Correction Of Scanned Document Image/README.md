Many a times, when the documents are scanned, the scanning skews the image i.e tilts the image, making it a little inconvenient to read. So we performed skew detection and correction with 2 methods in order to align the image properly.
Methods used:
1. Deskewing text with OpenCV and Python
2. Deskewing using Hough Transform
